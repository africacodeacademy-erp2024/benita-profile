Hello My Name is Benita Kazadi, I am 21 years old and an interesting fact about me is that i can eat peanuts but i hate peanut butter with an absolute passion
 I grew up in Botswana but i am originally from DRC. I grew up in a family consisting of my father, mother, oldesister and two younger brothers who have shaped me to be the person i am today.
My educational background: Hillcrest Primary School(2008-2015); Legae Academy(2016-2020); Botho University(2021-Present)
i am proud that i managed to finish school without repeating any grades and studying a course that may be dificult sometimes but still love. Apart from coding i like to knit, i see myself as a novice when it comes tho this but like coding i want to learn and improve on it
With this course i hope to learn how to learn and also hope to be able to improve on my  coding skills which my fellow coursemates can also agree on as well as improve my presentation skills which i hope to improve on as i have anxiety when it comes to public speaking.
